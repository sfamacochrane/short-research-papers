# short-research-papers
These are several research papers I did with open-source data for an applied statistics course. 

**Report 2** (there is no report 1) uses data from the American National Election Survey in 2020 on the question, "How worried are you about your current financian situation?", to examine whether worry was associated with supoprt for the Democratic Presidential candidate, controlling for other factors.    

**Report 3** uses data from the American National Election Survey in 1994 to ask whether educational attainment was associated with approval for Clinton's handling of health care reform, which aimed to increase health care subsidies.    

**Report 4** uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) to examine whether participation in high school sports increased educational attainment.    

**Report 5** also uses data from the Add Health survey to ask wehther work experience during high school affected future earnings.
